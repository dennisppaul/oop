> The VL-1 was the first instrument of Casio's VL-Tone product line, and is sometimes referred to as the VL-Tone. It combined a calculator, a monophonic synthesizer, and sequencer. Released in 1981, it was the first commercial digital synthesizer, selling for $69.95.
> … There were also 10 pre-loaded rhythms which utilized just three basic drum sounds. Casio internally named these sounds "Po" (30ms), "Pi" (20ms) and "Sha" (160ms).
> … The VL-1 was programmed by entering a number into the calculator section's memory, then switching back to keyboard mode.
