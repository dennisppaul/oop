> The Artiphon INSTRUMENT 1 is a new kind of digital instrument that adapts to the way you play. It’s the first MIDI controller that lets you strum, slide, tap, and drum any sound. Play music by connecting it to your favorite apps and DAWs, or by using the INSTRUMENT 1 iOS app. And you can play out loud through the built-in speakers or have a more private jam session using the ⅛” headphone jack.
