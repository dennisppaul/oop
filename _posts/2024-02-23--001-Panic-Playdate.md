my [Playdate](https://play.date) arrived a few weeks ago. i found some time to experiment with the extremely well-crafted simulator and the development environment. this, in it’s own right, impressive and worth exploring. 

however, the design of the hardware ( by [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/) ) is as expected also *really* nice. TBH what intrigued me more than anything where the hollow body screws … perfection ;) and the packaging is really, too.

PS { it is so much tinier than i thought }
