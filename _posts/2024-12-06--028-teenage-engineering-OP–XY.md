> the new evolution of sequencing. OP–XY is a powerful sequencer, synthesizer, and sampler. stack sounds on a 64-step grid, and create thousands of projects. tactile 24-key keyboard and a multi-out jack that lets you select one of four outputs. 8 unique synth engines, two send effect slots, plus brain™ for transposition—it’s a complete studio in the palm of your hand.
