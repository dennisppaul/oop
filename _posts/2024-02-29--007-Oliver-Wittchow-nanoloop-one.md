IMHO [Oliver Wittchow: nanoloop one](https://nanoloop.com/one/index.html) is one of the most enigmatic and genius *PCB-products* i have ever seen! it is simple, subtle and beautiful. 

in case you donâ€™t know, this is what nanoloop actually *is*:

> Nanoloop is a Stepsequencer which means that a pattern of 16 1/16 notes is played repeatedly while these notes can be edited in various respects like volume, pitch etc. There are four channels, playing simultaneously. Each channel's patterns can be saved to file slots in flash memory and are then available for new combinations. Finally, saved patterns can be arranged in a song structure.

PS { a few years ago, right after i bought a [nanoloop one](https://nanoloop.com/one/) cartridge, i had a brief mail interaction with oliver wittchow to find out how he built it. i am not going to disclose it here ;) but rather leave it up to him to do so ;) ;) }
