IMHO this is one of the most enigmatic and genius *PCB-products* i have ever seen! it is simple, subtle and beautiful. 

PS { a few years ago, right after i bought a nanoloop one cartridge, i had a brief mail interaction with oliver wittchow to find out how he built it. i am not going to disclose it here ;) but rather leave it up to him to do so ;) ;) }
