> Solid State Watch is a Casio F-91W movement permanently cast into a transparent resin case. It's in there forever. No buttons, no functions, no light, fully waterproof and no changing that 10 year battery.  
> 
> It just tells time.

in addition to the product i am also really intrigued by their disclaimer paragraph:

<div style="padding: 30px; font-size: 13px; color: #FFF; background: #0000FF; text-align: center;">
*** PLEASE NOTE ***
<br/><br/>
This is an experimental art project. Each piece is handmade in-house. We usually do a drop every few weeks and it takes some time to make each one (around 1-2 weeks).
<br/><br/>
If you order a SSW, you assume responsibility for inputting your desired UTC time and wrist size.
<br/><br/>
Please make sure you read this whole page <b style="font-size: 13px;">before placing your order</b> and are game with all the hooha. To be notified upon batch releases, scroll to the bottom to sign up for our newsletter and/or follow us on Instagram.
