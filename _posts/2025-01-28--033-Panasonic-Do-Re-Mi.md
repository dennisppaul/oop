> I recently got my hands on a pretty neat vintage item: theÂ **Panasonic Do-Re-Mi**. Itâ€™s essentially a little analog synth / organ with a built in record player. Panasonic also sold a version with a built-in tape deck, and another even rarer unit that Â just contained the synth portion on its own. All three versions were released in 1977, along with theÂ [Panapic multimedia system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quF45LvBtwA). The one I got was not in very good condition: I had to replace the capacitors, clean the keyboard, and replace the record needle, but I did eventually manage to get it back on its feet. Naturally, the very first thing I did once I got it working was sample it. This proved to be quite an easy task as it has only one sound. ðŸ™‚
