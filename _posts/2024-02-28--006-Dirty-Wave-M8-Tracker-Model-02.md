this is the second version of the iconic mod tracker. it still has mechanical keys, appears to still be based on teensy and is still all black :) 

me, however, i am still not such a big fan of mod trackers as musical interfaces ( although i do of course respect the interface and spent my fair share of time with trackers ) but i really, really do love the design of this device.

PS { as i am always interested in the structures which produce such devices i did a bit of digging to find out who is behind this one: it turns out it is Timothy Lamb aka [trash80](https://trash80.com) and Johan Kotlinski aka [Role Model](http://www.8bitpeoples.com/products/520230-role-model-a-new-fragrance), author of [LSDj](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php) and friend of [Goto80](https://www.goto80.com) who collaborated with [Jacob Remin](https://www.jacobremin.com) â€¦ small world ;). }
