I thought Iâ€™d start a collection of things that somehow caught my attention. Currently the focus lies on things that have something to do with music making ( in particular with digital music ), gaming consoles, and PCBs. Most things are somewhat useless but enjoyable to use, own, show and talk about.

This collection is loosely related to *Klangstrom* and its [Developer Diary](https://klangstrom.dennisppaul.de) but it is definitely maintained by [Dennis P Paul](https://dennisppaul.de).
