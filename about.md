I thought Iâ€™d start a collection of things that somehow caught my attention. Currently the focus lies on things that have something to do with music making ( in particular with digital music ), gaming consoles, and PCBs. Most things are somewhat useless but enjoyable to use, own, show and talk about. All things are ( or at least were at some point ) released as editions or ( mass ) products ( in contrast to one-off artistic works ).

This collection is loosely related to *Klangstrom* and its [Developer Diary](https://klangstrom.dennisppaul.de) but it is definitely maintained by [Dennis P Paul](https://dennisppaul.de).

I have decided to use a [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) policy for images, films, quotes, and other media types i.e i will download media where possible and store it in the `assets` folder of this repository, i will, however, preserve the original source URL in the `alt` tag and will refer to the source in the caption with the following *idiom*:

```
@source([Title](https://link.to.source), @date(YYYY-MM-DD))
```

i hope and believe that this is *fair*.
